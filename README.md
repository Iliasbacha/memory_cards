# 🧠 Memory Card Game for Bilingual Lexical Development

An educational serious game designed to enhance bilingual vocabulary acquisition (English–French) through dynamic, gamified learning.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This memory card game supports vocabulary development in English and French for learners of all proficiency levels. By combining word matching with translation challenges, the game fosters active recall, bilingual association, and motivation through play.

Originally developed as a personal exploration of gamification in education, this project reflects a deep interest in the intersection of cognitive engagement and pedagogical design — in line with serious games and educational technologies.

## 🕹️ How to Play

**Objective:** Match hidden cards and translate the matched English word to its French equivalent to earn points.

### Gameplay Steps:
- Players take turns selecting and flipping over cards to find matching English word pairs.
- Upon finding a match, the player must correctly translate the term to French.
- Points are awarded for correct translations.

**Winning:** The player with the most points after all pairs are matched wins.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Multiplayer Mode:** Promotes collaborative learning and social interaction.
- **Score Tracking:** Reinforces performance-based learning goals.
- **Randomized Word Pairs:** Ensures replayability and vocabulary diversity.
- **Adjustable Difficulty Levels:** Adapts to beginner and advanced learners.
- **Customizable Grid Sizes:** Offers flexible gameplay tailored to learner needs.

## 📚 Educational Objectives

- Develop bilingual lexical recall in English and French.
- Strengthen vocabulary through repetition and challenge-based learning.
- Encourage cognitive engagement and retention via gamified interaction.

## 🎮 Gamification Principles Applied

- **Challenge:** Memory + translation task creates dual-cognitive engagement.
- **Progression:** Score-based goals encourage performance improvement.
- **Feedback:** Immediate correctness check supports adaptive learning.
- **Volition:** Choice-based gameplay increases motivation and autonomy.

## 🧩 Future Directions

This game design could be adapted to:
- Teach **medical or healthcare vocabulary** (anatomy, diagnostics, pharmacology)
- Serve as a **foundation for a digital serious game** (Unity or web-based)
- Integrate **AI-driven personalization or spaced repetition algorithms**

## 🚀 Running and Rebuilding

After installing the required Python packages, you can start the game directly
from the source code:

```bash
python memory_translat.py
```

If you modify the code and would like a new standalone executable, rebuild it
with PyInstaller:

```bash
pyinstaller memory_translat.spec
```

Run the updated script or the rebuilt executable so that any changes take effect.
